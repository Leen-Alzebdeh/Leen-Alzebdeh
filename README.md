I'm an aspiring Software Developer in my fourth year of computing science at the University of Alberta.  

You can visit my [portfolio website](https://leenzebdeh.github.io/) to learn more about my work! Here are a few examples:

✅ Collaborated in a 7-member team to develop and deploy a business website for Zero RampUp using JavaScript.

✅ Worked as a Django backend developer to create a social network platform web app that is linked with other teams’ unique APIs and can aggregate activity from their web servers.

✅ Trained, tuned, and deployed various machine learning models with PyTorch and TensorFlow.

✅ Customized ML models, such as YOLOv5 and U-Net, to perform object detection and image segmentation.

✅ Experienced in AI and reinforcement learning algorithms, including A* search, Q-learning, and heuristic search.

✅ Developed and tested an Android social media app as a developer in a collaborative Scrum environment.

I get excited about opportunities where I'm able to work with highly creative people to develop innovative solutions using the latest technology.
